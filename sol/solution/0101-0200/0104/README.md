# [**104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### **Example 1:**

```md
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

### **Example 2:**
```md
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

### **Constraints:**
```md
• The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10⁴].
• -100 <= Node.val <= 100
```
