# [**101. Symmetric Tree**](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/description/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

### **Example 1:**

```md
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807
```

### **Example 2:**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leetcoin-releases/leetcode-solution/refs/heads/main/res/pin/472844188-87ad35db-301b-4ed2-b229-c104a81d4f2b.jpg" width="1580" height="600"/>

```md
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### **Constraints:**
```md
• The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
• -100 <= Node.val <= 100
```

### **Follow up:**
```md
Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
