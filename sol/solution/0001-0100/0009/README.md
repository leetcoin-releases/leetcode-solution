# [**9. Palindrome Number**](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

### **Example 1:**
```md
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

### **Example 2:**
```md
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### **Example 3:**
```md
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### **Constraints:**
```md
• -2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1
```

### **Follow up:**
```md
Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
